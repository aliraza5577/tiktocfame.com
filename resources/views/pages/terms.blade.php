            <h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Accessing or using the Citi Packaging web site constitutes acceptance of the Terms and Conditions contained herein. We reserve the right to update these Terms from time to time and without prior notice to you, so please check back periodically.</p>

            <h2>Copyright and Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>All work on this site, such as text, graphics, images, software and design related information are copyrights. You may not copy or distribute any of the material from this site without permission. In submitting orders, you acknowledge that you have all necessary rights and permissions to use any third-party content in your design.</p>

            <h3>User Submissions</h3>
            <p>You agree and acknowledge that you are solely responsible for the content or images you upload and any text designs. This ensures that no submission made by you infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Upon uploading your content, you grant Citi Packaging the non-exclusive license to reproduce and use your materials for fulfilling your orders.</p>

            <h3>Resolution of Design Files</h3>
            <p>Citi Packaging supply files at 72 DPI, which is low resolution. If you need high-resolution files, we can provide a quote for the specific project.</p>

            <h2>Proofing and Approval</h2>
            <p>The final design proof must be approved by you before sending to print. Ensure that all your details, such as layout, colors, text, and specifications, are correct. Citi Packaging will not be held liable for errors discovered once the order has been sent to the customer for approval. We suggest printing a physical proof for you to check the design elements in actuality.</p>

            <h3>Customer Artwork Guidelines</h3>
            <p>All submitted artwork should be in CMYK color mode with a minimum resolution of 300 DPI. Citi Packaging shall not be liable for anything resulting from errors in formats or low resolutions from the customer.</p>

            <h2>Colour Matching and Accuracy</h2>
            <p>While using best practice to guarantee the reproduction of colors as accurately as possible, note that a certain level of difference is unavoidable due to the unique characteristics of the print and the property of the paper material used. Where color accuracy is essential, we can deliver a hardcopy proof for a charge.</p>

            <h2>Materials Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Unless otherwise specified, most of the products use non-food-grade paper and materials for Citi Packaging. If you have specific requirements for special materials, kindly communicate these to us before making your order.</p>

            <h2>Order Cancellation Policy</h2>
            <p>Orders can be canceled before the printing starts, but cancellation charges might be applied depending upon the stages involved in producing it. Once a printed or shipped order has been made, no changes, nor cancellation is allowed.</p>

            <h2>Returns and Refunds</h2>
            <p>Because our products are custom-made, all sales are final. However, if we messed up your order, we'll reorder and print the product. Let us know within three business days of receipt of your order in case there's a problem with that order.</p>

            <h3>Shipping and Delivery</h3>
            <p>Citi Packaging offers shipment options. The shipping timeline of standard options is not guaranteed; it is only an estimate. Expedited options provide the choice of specific delivery windows and are guaranteed. We accept no liability for third-party carrier delays or customs delays.</p>

            <h3>Damaged and Lost Packages</h3>
            <p>Inspect your shipments upon receiving them. Report missing or damaged items within three business days. Claims post-three business days will be subject to denial.</p>

            <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
            <p>Citi Packaging provides the site "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We shall not be liable for any loss or inconvenience arising from access or any inability to access the site or from any service interruption. Neither does linking to third parties' goods or services imply endorsement or warranty.</p>
            <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>

You use the site and all activities happening from this site entirely at your risk.</p>
